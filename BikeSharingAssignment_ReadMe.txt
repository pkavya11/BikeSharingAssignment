# BikeSharingAssignment
> The project is to analyse with linear regression algorithm which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands as per the given dataset.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion is that the model algorithm built in this project is fit with the data and the model is aptly able to predict the values of bike demands based on the independent variables data given and model built by me.
